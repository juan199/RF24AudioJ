# Arduino Wireless Audio Transmission Library For Guitar/Bass with effects
  
This library allows streaming of audio from analog inputs via NRF24L01 radio modules
See the [documentation section](http://tmrh20.github.io/) for more info about the libraries used to generate the library RF24AudioJ
  
The effects are applied on the RF24AudioJ.cpp file under the section name Tx transmition (Bothrops_Asper_Effect), an improvement is to change this into the arduino ide to allow better control and understandment.
